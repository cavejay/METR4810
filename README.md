METR4810 -- Autonomous Racecar

This was a 4th year project based course that required students to work in small teams of 4 to create manufacture a small, automated vehicle capable of driving aroud a pre-set, modular racecourse. The vehicle needed to be driven around the track by a path finding system that processed the input from 4 different track-facing cameras.     

This repo acts as an archive for the work undertaken during that course.
