1* The PWM signal can jump from a high angle to a low angle via single inputs of that low angle (through the Servo.h library)
	This just means there is no need to run back through angles in the code (i.e. if we are at a full right turn and want to go left)

2* The maximum allowed angle in the dagu 8g Servo Motor seems to be approx. 160 degrees
	This has been communicated to Xavier

3* A single Bump sensor has been used to simulate input in controlling the Servo
	As soon as we get our hands on the bluetooth module, received signals from that would replace these
	- I REPEAT, WE ARE NOT using a bump sensor for the actual project implementation

4* As the calculations by Xavier on turning ability state we require around 270 degrees
	This Servo is not feasible, we need a full rotational servo
	UNLESS, we use one for each wheel
	OR, we have a massive gear ratio (which again is not feasible given size restrictions)
